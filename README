-------

This project implements an object-oriented framework for implementing
spatially-explicit ecological models. It implements a limited set of features
from the following projects:
 * SimApp (Cline 1999-2004), a C++ CORBA-based simulation framework,
 * ecological framework or "ef" (Saponara 1997), a C++ framework for discrete-
   time, discrete-space, individual-based ecological simulations, and
 * simdriver (Cline 2001-2003),a generic SimApp-based ATLSS driver.

The efscape package uses adevs, C++-based implementation of the DEVS (Discrete
EVent System Specification) modeling methdology (Zeigler 1974) as the core
simulation engine.
